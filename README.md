# 1.Architecture
we propose a novel Pyramid Attention U-Net architecture for feature extraction, which generates initial salient objects. We then build a Residuals Efficient Channel Attention Transformer network (RECA-Transformer) to refine the edge details, ultimately achieving comprehensive boundary-aware prediction of salient objects.
